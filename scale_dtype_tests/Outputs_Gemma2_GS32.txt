 f32: Q: How does gradient descent work? A: Gradient descent is a method for finding the minimum of a function. It is based on the idea that the function is changing at a constant rate. The gradient of the function is the slope of the function at a given point. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest descent. The gradient is the negative of the gradient of the function. The gradient is the negative of the gradient of the function. The gradient is the negative of the gradient of the function. The gradient is

 f16: Q: How does gradient descent work? A: Gradient descent is a method of finding the minimum of a function. It is a method of finding the minimum of a function by taking small steps in the direction of the steepest descent. The steepest descent is the direction in which the function is decreasing the most rapidly. The steepest descent is the direction in which the function is decreasing the most rapidly. The steepest descent is the direction in which the function is decreasing the most rapidly. The steepest descent is the direction in which the function is
