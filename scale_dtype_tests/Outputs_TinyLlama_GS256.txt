 f32: Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. Lily was a kind-hearted girl who loved to read. She would often spend hours in the library, surrounded by books and paperbacks. One day, Lily's father died, leaving her with nothing but the clothes on her back. Lily was devastated. She had always been a shy and introverted girl, and now she was alone and without a home. Lily's mother was a kind-

 f32: Q: What is the difference between integration and differentiation? A: Integration is a process of finding the value of a function over a given interval, while differentiation is a process of finding the derivative of a function over a given interval. Integration is used to find the value of a function, while differentiation is used to find the derivative of a function. Q: What is the concept of a limit? A: A limit is a point in the real line where a function approaches a given value. Q: What is the concept of a Taylor series?

 f32: Q: How does gradient descent work? A: Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm that is used to find the local minima of a function. It works by iteratively updating the parameters of the model until the loss function (the sum of squared errors) converges to a local minimum. The algorithm works by finding the direction of the gradient of the loss function at the current parameter values. It then updates the parameters by taking the gradient of the loss function with respect to the current parameter values and the current loss function value. The algorithm then

 f16: Q: How does gradient descent work? A: Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm that is used to find the local minima of a function. It works by iteratively updating the model parameters (i.e., the coefficients of the model) using the gradient of the loss function. The algorithm starts with the current model parameters and updates them by minimizing the gradient of the loss function. The gradient descent algorithm works by iteratively updating the model parameters until the loss function has decreased significantly. The algorithm works by finding the direction of the
